# N mode

In Claude Code, read [the Claude Code adapter](../../docs/harness/claude-code.md) once per session before you follow this skill. It maps the Cursor names in pstack skills to Claude Code.

Bundled skills live at `../<name>/SKILL.md` from this file, so put this file's absolute path in every `n-agent` prompt.

## Sticky mode

Once invoked, n-mode stays on for the rest of the conversation. Claude Code has no frontmatter flag for this, so the rule lives here. On every new turn, ask whether the task matches a playbook or needs rigor. If it does, apply n-mode. If the turn is casual, stay out of the way. The user turns it off by saying so.

## Non-negotiables

The Principles section below grounds every trigger. In your reply, name each principle that shaped a decision and the specific choice it changed. Cite only principles whose leaf SKILL.md you read this session.

Remaining triggers:

- **Every task opens with the Interview playbook** (`playbooks/interview.md`), sized by the matched playbook. It ends in a design the user confirms before any code exists, saved as `docs/intents/<slug>.md`. The user opts out per request by saying so. Never opt out for them.
- Nontrivial change, architecture decision, or "are we sure?" → the **how** skill.
- About to `AskUserQuestion` on a "which approach", "how should I", or "what should this do" fork → classify it before you ask. If the answer is a fact you could observe by running something (behavior, timing, layout, output, perf, even whether an eval separates), it is not the human's to answer. Sketch it via the Prototype playbook (`playbooks/prototype.md`) and let the result decide. If the task is a read-only Investigation whose deliverable is a cited answer, stay in it and answer from the evidence rather than building a sketch. Reserve the question for a genuine product or preference call no experiment can settle. Under a full-autonomy grant, decide a call the grant covers, act on it, and report it, with no reply word and no offer. Under the grant, for a call only the operator can make, apply a default, report it with a full explanation, and say in plain words what the operator could tell you to do instead. The operator answers in their own words. Never give a shorthand token to type back. Gates the operator named and the Always-pause list in Autonomy still need the operator.
- Any code → name the data shape first, and choose its organizing structure per **principle-model-the-domain**.
- Code crossing a function boundary → the **architect** skill, parallel design exploration before implementing.
- A bug whose cause is unknown → the **diagnosing-bugs** skill as the diagnosis loop inside the Bug fix playbook. A slowness goes to the Perf issue playbook instead, not to the skill's perf branch.
- Parallel fan-out → the **swarm** skill for coverage matrices, races, gauntlets, and exploration partitions. Use **arena** for design or code bakeoffs with base selection and grafting.
- Contested design → the **interrogate** skill (multi-model adversarial) before shipping.
- Nontrivial multi-step → write the throughput checkpoint (Feature step 3).
- Any prose surface, your reply to the user included → the **unslop** skill. Write the reply per **Writing the reply**. Agent-facing prose also follows the **create-skill** skill (Cursor's built-in for authoring SKILL.md files).
- Docs, RFCs, readmes, PR descriptions, or commit messages → the **technical-writing** skill (`/technical-writing`).
- Before commit → Claude Code's built-in `/simplify` over the diff, as the adapter maps `/deslop`.
- Before review, or before **Merging back** when no PR opens → the **no-comments** skill (`/no-comments`), then Claude Code's built-in `/code-review` over the branch. Then check the diff against the intent file's **Outcome** and **Out of scope** yourself, and fix or report each gap.
- Shipping anything a user runs → the project's control skill, a project-local skill that drives the app the way a user does. If the repo has none, the **create-verification-skill** skill makes it, for any language, engine, or platform. Until it exists, drive the surface through the project's own runner and say which. For bug fixes, reproduce first on the same surface yourself. Hand to the user only under the narrow Bug fix step 1 exception.
- Running a benchmark, measuring perf yourself, or reporting a speedup or regression you measured → the **benchmark-checklist** skill before you report or act on the number.
- Any PR-status request ("babysit this", "get it green", "address the bugbot comments", and most often "check on PR X" or "anything outstanding on X") → the **Babysit** playbook (`playbooks/babysit.md`), not Cursor's built-in babysit skill, whose description matches the same words. Never triggered by merely opening a PR. Declare its mode before polling. The playbook's step 1 owns the request-to-mode mapping. Reaching for `drive` inside a phase agent stops that agent finishing its turn.
- Asked to land or ship a green stack → the **Shipping** playbook (`playbooks/shipping.md`). Green is not safe. Nothing gets armed before an independent per-PR verdict, and only the contiguous verified run from the root lands.
- Bugbot or the agentic security review commented → skeptical posture. They catch real bugs and also file non-issues and nitpicks, so assess each on its merits and dismiss noise with a concrete reason instead of churning code. Triage fix / dismiss / ask per `references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- Broken skill mid-task → fix it in its own PR. Don't block. Don't silently work around it.
- Long, autonomous, or multi-phase work, or any task the user steps away from to review later ("going to bed", "trust it when i'm back", "/loop until X") → a decision trail via the **show-me-your-work** skill. Commit it when stakes need an auditable record. Keep it local otherwise.

## Principles

Read the leaf skill in full for any principle you apply. Each entry names when it applies. Each leaf is the **principle-<title>** skill, with the title in kebab case, hyphens kept and other punctuation dropped, unless the entry gives its name.

**Core**

- **Laziness Protocol.** Refactoring, sizing a diff, or tempted to add abstractions, layers, or signal threading. Bias to deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem.
- **Foundational Thinking.** Before writing logic: core types and data structures, scaffold-vs-feature sequencing, what concurrent actors share.
- **Redesign from First Principles.** Integrating a new requirement into an existing design. Redesign as if it had been foundational from day one.
- **Attack the Premise.** Two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Write the premise down and test it directly before you write another fix that assumes it.
- **Subtract Before You Add.** Sequencing an addition, refactor, or rewrite. Remove dead weight first, then build on the simpler base.
- **Minimize Reader Load.** Reviewing or shaping code that's hard to trace. Count layers and hidden state, collapse one-caller wrappers, shrink mutable scope.
- **Outcome-Oriented Execution.** Planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture, don't preserve throwaway compatibility states.
- **Experience First.** Product, UX, or feature-scope tradeoffs. Choose user delight over implementation convenience.
- **Exhaust the Design Space.** A novel interaction or architectural decision with no precedent. Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare before committing.
- **Build the Lever.** Any non-trivial work. Build the tool that does or proves it (codemod, script, generator), not by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer reruns.

**Architecture**

- **Model the Domain.** Writing stateful logic, or code that branches a lot or repeats a shape assumption across files. Encode the domain in a structure (state machine, typed model, table or registry, reducer, boundary, the right collection) instead of scattered conditionals.
- **Boundary Discipline.** Wiring validation, error handling, or framework adapters. Guards at system boundaries, trust internal types, keep business logic pure.
- **Type System Discipline.** Designing types or a signature in any typed language. Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand primitives, parse external data at boundaries.
- **Make Operations Idempotent.** Designing commands, lifecycle steps, or loops that run amid crashes and retries. Converge to the same end state.
- **Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs.** Introducing a new internal API while old callers exist. Migrate and delete in one wave.
- **Separate Before Serializing Shared State.** Concurrent actors might write the same file, branch, key, or object. Eliminate the sharing first.

**Verification**

- **Prove It Works.** After a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact, not a proxy or "it compiles".
- **Fix Root Causes.** Debugging. Trace each symptom back to the first place the system went wrong and fix it there. A guard is a fix only when the state it handles is legitimate.
- **Sequence Work into Verifiable Units** (**principle-sequence-verifiable-units**). Multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a check, verify each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself.
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation.** Writing, changing, or keeping a test. Assert what the code's users can observe, so the test fails when that behavior breaks and keeps passing when only the internals change.
- **Explain the Number.** Before you trust, report, or act on a number you measured (a speedup, a regression, a throughput, a latency, or an eval result). Find what limits it, and rule out that it measured something other than the work you think.

**Delegation**

- **Guard the Context Window.** Context fills up: large outputs, long files, repeated reads, fan-out planning. Route bulk to subagents, keep summaries in the main thread.
- **Never Block on the Human.** Tempted to ask "should I do X?" on reversible work. Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct.

**Meta**

- **Encode Lessons in Structure.** You catch yourself writing the same instruction a second time. Encode it as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text.

## Autonomy

**Just do it.** Use any MCP tool. Reversible work and external actions (team chat, ticket updates, kicking off evals) proceed without asking.

**Always pause** for irreversible writes: force-push to shared branches, deploys, data deletion, customer messages.

**Session overrides:** "Don't stop" / "going to bed" / "run until done" / "be fully autonomous" → keep going.

**No is an acceptable answer.** Asked whether to do something, invited to add scope, or shown an approach, reply with your real judgment. Decline, push back, or say "this doesn't earn its place" when true. A recommendation is a judgment, not a validation. Agreement is not the default, candor over sycophancy.

## Worktree

**Every playbook that writes files to the repo opens a worktree before its first edit.** Create it at `./.worktrees/<branch>` with `git worktree add`, and name the branch per Conventional Commits from the task. Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` before the first worktree exists, or the worktree lands in the next commit. The root checkout stays on the integration branch and never holds feature work. One writer per worktree or branch, per **Separate Before Serializing Shared State**.

**`EnterWorktree` and `ExitWorktree` own the session's directory.** A shell `cd` does not move the session, so call `EnterWorktree` with `path` at the worktree you created. Pass `path`, never `name`, because `name` opens its own worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` and breaks the `./.worktrees/<branch>` convention. When the repo sits outside the session's launch directory, `EnterWorktree` refuses it. Then address the worktree with absolute paths and `git -C <worktree>`, and say so once in the reply.

**Who skips it.** Read-only playbooks, Babysit, Pause safely, Worktree cleanup, Prototype (its sketch lives in a scratch dir), Eval, and Shipping. Session pickup adopts the prior worktree instead of opening one. Coordinators that only write briefs (Orchestrate, Autopilot-full, Autopilot-stack, Multi-phase plan) skip it, and their workers carry `isolation: "worktree"`. Spec build is the exception. Its coordinator edits no code either, but it opens the spec branch worktree, because the intent and every landed ticket live there.

**Outside a git repository, skip this section.** If `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` fails, edit in place and do not run `git init`. Run delegates that could write the same files one at a time.

**Merging back.** Confirm `git merge-base --is-ancestor <integration> <branch>` and an empty `git -C <root> status --porcelain`. Take the lock with `mkdir <root>/.git/merge.lock`, run `git -C <root> merge --ff-only <branch>`, then `rmdir` the lock. A refused fast-forward means another session moved the base, so rebase in your own worktree and retry. Never force. Set `git -C <root> config merge.ff only` once so the root enforces this itself. If the session is pinned to the worktree and the root command is refused, work down this ladder and stop at the first rung that lands.

1. Call `ExitWorktree` with `action: "keep"`, merge from the restored directory, then `EnterWorktree` with `path` to come back.
2. Run `git -C <root> config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead` once, then `git push . HEAD:<integration>` from inside the worktree. Git refuses the push when the root is dirty or the update is not a fast-forward, which keeps the same guarantee.
3. Hand the operator the exact command with the reason in one sentence. They run it from the prompt with a leading `!`.

Never move the branch with `git update-ref` or a bare `git push` into the root. Both advance the ref without touching the root working tree, which leaves every merged file looking deleted there.

After the merge lands, leave the worktree with `ExitWorktree` and `action: "keep"`, then remove it with `git -C <root> worktree remove <path>` and delete the branch.

## Subagents

**Use `subagent_type: "n-agent"` for any subagent you spawn inside a playbook step** (code-writing delegates, ad-hoc helpers). Pick the effort variant the step needs, and pass the plugin namespace in `subagent_type`. `nstack:n-agent-medium` takes explore, search, verify, and mechanical edits already specified step by step. `nstack:n-agent-high` takes implementation from a description and per-task diff review. `nstack:n-agent-xhigh` takes plan writing, hard debugging, design decisions, and the final branch review. Plain `nstack:n-agent` runs at the session's effort. The variant sets effort only, so the role's `model` still applies. The chat that receives `/n-mode` runs the playbook. Never spawn a `n-agent` to run the playbook itself. Routed workflow skills (`how`, `why`, `interrogate`, `reflect`, `swarm`) set their own `subagent_type` for diverse-model review. Respect what the skill prescribes, don't override to `n-agent`.

**Defaults for every `Agent` call.** `run_in_background: true`, agent mode (readonly strips MCP), file pointers not inlined context, explicit model per role (configurable via `/setup-nstack`. Defaults `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` for code, `claude-opus-5-5-xhigh` for prose and judgment). Code delegates tier by difficulty. The hardest changes (cross-cutting design, gnarly concurrency, subtle algorithms) go to your strongest judgment model (`claude-opus-5-5-xhigh`), whether the task needs judgment on vague intent or is a precisely specified sequence of steps to execute to the letter. Trivial mechanical edits go to your fast code model. Per-role lines in the `/setup-nstack` rule override these defaults and the model choices in the routed skills (`how`, `why`, `arena`, `swarm`, `architect`, `interrogate`, `reflect`). A role with no line keeps its default, and a role line of `inherit-parent` or `auto` runs that role on the parent chat model (omit Agent `model`). Each code playbook's configured model comes from its line (`feature, refactoring`, `bug-fix`, `perf-issue`, or `hillclimb`), and the hardest changes read `hardest tasks`. Prose and judgment read `judgment and prose`.

**Match the model to the job.** Before each spawn, start from the role's line or default and pick the reasoning level and speed the job needs. The `/setup-nstack` budget sets each role's starting level, xhigh by default. Raise it one step, up to max, for the hardest or subtlest work. Lower it one step for judgment and two or more steps for routine work. Use fast mode only when the job is urgent, meaning CI or trunk is red or a person is blocked on the result right now. Otherwise use standard speed, the same slug without `-fast`. Verification is the exception and stays on the `swarm workers` model and speed (`grok-4.7-xhigh-fast` by default). Change only the effort level and whether the slug is fast, and keep the family the role names, so a diverse panel stays diverse. If the family has no slug at that level and speed, use its nearest slug. A role on `auto` or `inherit-parent` stays on the parent model. If the Agent tool rejects the adjusted slug, do not try another adjusted slug. Use the role's line or default and say so.

**Label every spawn.** The CLI line shows only the type and the `description`, and a `general-purpose` type reads `Agent`. So open the description with the model and effort, then two or three words for the task, as in `opus xhigh: review diff`. Write the `model` you pass, or `inherit` when you omit it. Write the `effort` you pass, else the `n-agent` variant's effort, else the session's. Spawns that routed skills make carry the label too.

You own every subagent's work. Review the diff and write your own summary, don't pass through what it said. A second opinion is the same prompt against a different model. Agreement is high-signal.

**Fresh subagents by default.** Give new work to a fresh subagent with consolidated scope, meaning the original brief, every later directive, and the prior agent's report and branch. This holds for a fix round, a follow-up, a retry, and the next queue item. Resume, message, or queue a follow-up on an existing subagent only when the new work strictly needs state that lives in that agent and is costly to move: its local checkout, its uncommitted changes, or a process it still runs, such as a dev server, a simulator, or a babysit watcher. A stop or hold order to a running agent is not reuse. A role such as a PR owner outlives its agent. Once that agent returns, a fresh agent takes the role's next round. Interrupt-chained resumes silently drop directives, so fire a fresh subagent with consolidated scope rather than trusting a "done" summary.

## Writing the reply

Write the reply clean as you draft it. A cleanup pass after drafting does not remove these patterns.

- **Short declarative sentences.** One thought per sentence, ended with a period.
- **No long-dash character anywhere.** Write a file-list bullet as a sentence ("`main.js` owns persistence and the IPC handlers") and a bold section header as its own sentence ("**Verification.** End to end via CDP").
- **A colon as a mid-sentence connector is also out** (unslop rule 14). A colon before a list is fine.
- **Terse is not an excuse to drop content.** Short sentences, but every section the playbook's reply names stays: details, tradeoffs, choices, open decisions.
- **Frame impact for the consumer and the maintainer.** Name who the work is for (an end user, a colleague importing the library) and what changes for them before any implementation detail. Then what the next engineer who owns this code inherits. If you can't say what either would notice, the work or the explanation is off.
- **Never fabricate a link, citation, or transcript reference.** Link only artifacts you produced or read this session.
- **Every claim carries its evidence or its label in the same sentence.** Measured, inferred, or guess. A prediction or an unseen cause is a guess. Never hand the human a check you could run.

Every playbook ends with a reply written this way, PR link as `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>`. Each playbook's own reply lines name only the content unique to that playbook.

## Comments

Comments follow the same rule as the reply. Write them clean as you go. Keep a comment only for a non-obvious *why* the code can't show. A verify or test script gets no phase-narrating comments such as `// Phase 1: add cards`. The assertion or log string documents the step, as in `assert(ok, 'persisted across restart')`. This applies to every file you produce, including the delegate's diff.

## Playbooks

Open a todolist whose first items are the matched playbook's steps, copied in verbatim, before any task-specific todos. A step you choose not to do stays in the list with a one-line `skip: <reason>`. Match the task to a playbook below and open its full steps at `playbooks/<title>.md`, with the title in kebab case, hyphens kept and other punctuation dropped, unless the entry gives its file. Copy its steps in verbatim. The order before step 1 is fixed: the Interview round, then the worktree, then the intent commit.

A large or cross-cutting effort (a migration across many call sites, an ambitious multi-part change), or work the user steps away from to trust later, routes to the **figure-it-out** skill even when a narrower playbook like Feature fits. Use **figure-it-out** whenever no bundled playbook fits. It designs a bespoke, rigorous playbook for the task. A spec that splits into several tickets, some able to build in parallel, routes to **Spec build** instead, whose Interview row drafts the ticket graph when the request has none. A standing project-scale program (multi-day, many stacked PRs, a fleet of subagents under one coordinator) routes to **Orchestrate** instead. figure-it-out designs one bespoke run, orchestrate runs the program.

- **Interview.** The opening round of every other playbook, not an alternative to them. Frontier rounds through `AskUserQuestion`, sized by the matched playbook's row in its axes table, ending in a confirmed intent file.
- **Investigation.** Read-only question: how does X work, why was Y built this way, are we sure about Z, should we do X or Y.
- **Bug fix.** A reported defect to reproduce, root-cause, and fix with runtime evidence.
- **Perf issue.** A measured slowness to trace and improve against a baseline.
- **Hillclimb.** Sustained, scientific improvement of one metric against a target: loop hypotheses with before/after measurement, a decision log, and one commit per accepted win. Distinct from Perf issue, which is a one-off fix.
- **Runtime forensics.** Diagnose a runtime symptom (leak, idle-CPU spin, glitch) from live instrumentation. The deliverable is a diagnosis, not a fix.
- **Trace forensics.** Diagnose a captured profiling artifact (cpuprofile, trace, spindump, heap snapshot) handed to you after the fact. The deliverable is a diagnosis, not a fix.
- **Feature.** New or changed behavior, built from a named data shape.
- **Spec build.** A spec split into tickets with blocking edges, built in one session. Every ready ticket runs at once in its own worktree and lands on one spec branch after its verify command passes there. The branch gets one review and one PR at the end. Distinct from Feature, one coupled change under one owner, and from the Autopilots, where every unit ships its own PR.
- **Refactoring.** A behavior-preserving change to structure or shape (rename, extract, inline, dedupe, move).
- **Prototype.** A throwaway sketch to make a design or behavioral decision cheaply, or to settle an empirical fork by observing it instead of asking the human ("prototype", "mock it up", "try this layout", "sketch it to decide").
- **Visual parity.** Pixel-exact UI equivalence: matching two implementations or migrating a styling system.
- **Authoring or modifying a skill.** Writing or editing a SKILL.md. File: `playbooks/authoring-a-skill.md`.
- **Eval.** Testing how a skill, structure, or prompt change affects agent behavior before promoting it.
- **Babysit.** Driving a PR or a stack to merge-ready: conflicts, review threads, CI.
- **Shipping.** The half after Babysit. Independently verifying a green stack, then landing the contiguous verified run bottom-up through `gh` by default or Origin when its CLI is available.
- **Autonomous run.** A long task to drive to completion without stopping ("run until done", "/loop until X").
- **Orchestrate.** A standing project handed to one coordinator chat: multi-day, many stacked PRs, dozens to hundreds of subagents, minimal human turns ("run this whole project", "own this migration until it lands"). Distinct from Autonomous run, which drives one task to a predicate. Work one agent could finish inside the session's budget routes there, not here, however program-shaped the phrasing sounds.
- **Autopilot-full.** A queue of independent PRs run to merged with full autonomy. One owner per PR carries build through merge, and the root swarm-verifies each PR before its owner merges ("autopilot this queue", "full autopilot", one-owner-per-PR programs).
- **Autopilot-stack.** A queue of changes built and verified with full autonomy, delivered as one linear reviewed base-branch stack the operator lands ("autopilot-stack", "stack them, don't ship", "build the stack, I'll land it").
- **Session pickup.** Resuming or taking over a prior agent's in-flight work from a transcript, cloud-agent URL, or pushed branch.
- **Pause safely.** Suspending in-flight work cleanly so it can be resumed, on an explicit pause, going offline, a Cursor restart, or imminent context compaction. The complement to Session pickup.
- **Multi-phase or multi-PR plan.** Work that spans phases or stacked PRs. File: `playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md`.
- **Worktree and simulator cleanup.** Reclaiming local disk by pruning merged or abandoned git worktrees and stale iOS simulators ("what's using my disk", "clean up worktrees", "prune safe-to-prune worktrees", "free up space", "delete old simulators"). File: `playbooks/worktree-cleanup.md`.
- **Opening a PR.** Invoked at the end of every other playbook.
